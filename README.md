# Picoblaze-Microcontroller
The Picoblaze 8-bit microcontroller is our Digital System Design project. The language used is VHDL. The circuit was designed following the official Xilinx docs.
The microcontroller reads a program from memory and executes it:
  -It has 16 8-bit registers, which can be used for various instructions
  -The instruction set is similar to that of Assembly: ADD, SUB, AND, OR, JUMP, INPUT, OUTPUT, etc.
  -For the purpose of our project, the clock is mapped to a button in order to trace the program.
  -The program must be decoded and uploaded to memory manually, but compilers are available online.
More information is available in the official Xilinx documentation.
